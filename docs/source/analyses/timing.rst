ekea Timing Generation App
==============================

This application consists of two applications: "ktimegen" and "ktimeview".

"ktimegen" app takes the same kernel marking for kernel generation. However, instead of kernel, this app generates raw timing of the kernel region from all MPI processes and OpenMp threads per every invocation. The generated raw timing data is saved in JSON format for later use.

"ktimeview" reads the JSON file generated by "ktimegen" and generates interactive timing plots using the "Bokeh" plotting library. Using this app, users can explore the timing data on a Web browser.
